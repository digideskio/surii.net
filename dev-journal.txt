===cors===
So, iriscouch doesn't allow cross domain posting. That's odd and will make this website harder to do. I have to have then enable cors or write a proxy. A PHP proxy might be the way to go. There absolutely must be a boilerplate one around somewhere.

===layout===
I already forget how the site works :)

===css===
There are two css files: style & apps. I suppose style is general surii main page style and apps is for client apps? Yep, apps only need include apps.css.

===js===
Now that that's covered, what about JavaScript? I think I want to somehow add support to see the site in other mobile browsers. But games won't work because they expect the A & B buttons which the iPhone doesn't have. Some games are all touch though. The most I'll do is not automatically scroll the skinny and t-bone screens if I don't detect a 3DS.

===tiny===
I had to fix TinyCart b/c the links are all now t.co.

== on database ==
I need to better define for myself the structure of the database. The main surii database will have all the friend code and pigmii info.

== on security ==
I think CouchDB can be secured from unauthorized updates by some "validation function" which will ignore row updates made by users who did not create the database.
